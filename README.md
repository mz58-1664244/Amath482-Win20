My projects include different exploratory and objective data analysis methods applied to different areas.

In particular,

hw1: Locate the trajectory of a marble using Fast Fourier Transform.

hw2: Do spectral analysis on pieces of music using Gabor Transform.

hw3: Analyze dynamics of a bucket using Principal Component Analysis.

hw4: Classify clips of music using Linear Discriminant Analysis.

hw5: Classify fashion clothes images using Neural Network.
